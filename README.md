<h1>PROPERTIES OF DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE</h1>
Crypto Exchange is a program that starts digital coin trading. It can be explained better with an example from the stock market. In its present condition, while stock exchanges show the use of stocks, the crypto exchange manages the trade of digital assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges are a comparatively new concept. However, people have started to get used to it fully.Since many investors worldwide are interested in blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, it is crucial to know the types of crypto exchanges. One such platform is ‘Decentralized Crypto Exchange,’ and we at Purplex are here to discuss its features. They are:

<h1>Privacy</h1>
Decentralized Exchange or DEX must be your first choice if you are looking for absolute privacy as they are anonymous. While centralized exchange might ask you for KYC verification, DEX functions on the foundation of anonymity.

<h1>Its Comparatively Cheap</h1>
DEX operates on self-regulation and automation principles that make them affordable compared to Centralized exchange. On the other hand, centralized exchange carries an additional set-up cost and infrastructure maintenance to grant secured services. DEX helps to take out all the extra costs.

<h1>Money Control</h1>
You have perfect control over your online funds and wallet. To carry out trade-offs it doesn’t require transferring your digital funds to your wallet or any deposit account for trading. Ultimately, registering to an e-wallet increases risk, like in centralized exchanges.With that being said, DEX comes with its fair share of disadvantages, along with the disadvantage that it doesn’t allow fiat currency trades. But, we will offer many advantages- 
1. Funds investment in PurpleX would be invested in top 05 Stock markets.
2. Customer will get the benefits of Inflation in currency.
3. Growth of top 5 different economy.

<h1>NFT</h1>
Cryptocurrencies are released and remain in a public directory maintained by a common term called ‘Blockchain.’ The directory or directory is spread across a network of computers working on blockchain software. Any single entity does not control the database. Any individual can access the database, claim ownership, and trade cryptocurrencies through the private keys connected to their digital crypto wallet.
Like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are supplied on blockchain used for appointing the ownership of a specific asset. Every NFT is connected to unique data, usually a digital content file, and controlled by a ‘Smart contract.’ The method of changing a media file into a non-fungible token is called ‘minting’ NFTs. Similar to cryptocurrency, NFT is formulated to the database of the applicable blockchain.
Contrary to cryptocurrency, since NFTs are non-fungible, it is unique and non replaceable with other NFTs. While one bitcoin equals another, two NFTs cannot be the same. And similar to bitcoins, the NFT ownership record is registered on the blockchain database. As NFTs are recently discovered, regulations and existing laws applied to NFTs are limited.
Despite these uncertainties, creators find NFTs as an exciting medium. Extraordinarily, content regarding NFTs on the internet can indeed be owned by an individual liberated by a central negotiator. This trend is opening new exciting opportunities for e-commerce and engagement.

<h1>How To Integrate NFTs?</h1>
Essentially, there are seven ways to integrate NFTs into a business. With the help of infrastructure partners that support multiple use cases, flexible blockchains, and marketplaces it is crucial to consider NFTs with these seven steps.Nowadays, many solutions are vertically integrated, and the expectations are that they will become the more flexible business solutions.

<h1>Identifying NFT Use Case</h1>
Firstly, there should be an adjustment on the usage of NFTs. There are various design mechanisms of an NFT depending on the use case, like distribution and edition size. The few most well-known use cases to date are gaming, art, experience, and other collectibles.
Collectibles: The virtual scarcity that NFTs authorise is a regular fit for assets and collectibles whose value depends on their limited supply. A portion of the earliest NFTs includes CryptoPunks4 and CryptoKitties3 (around 10 thousand unique pixelated characters), along with separate CryptoPunk NFT such as Covid Alien trading at $11.75 million.
Most recently, many famous companies have been developing collectibles based on NFTs. For instance, NBA Top 6 Moments are digital basketball cards, but they highlight moments rather than static images from NBA games.
Art: NFTs allow the artists to put their work on sale in its naturalistic aspect ratios instead of selling art pieces. Additionally, unlike physical art, the artist can generate revenue through auctions and secondary sales. Thus, ensuring that they are acknowledged by their original creations in the following transactions. The NFT market focused on art-based NFT like Nifty Gateway7 was auctioned/sold at 100 million dollars in March 2021.
Gaming: NFTs also offers an outstanding gaming world opportunity to introduce ownership opportunities. While most people spend billions on virtual gaming resources like Fortnite skins, the users don’t necessarily possess these assets. NFTs lets the gamers that play crypto-based games purchase in-game assets, transfer them to their inventory and trade them over the open marketplace.
